# Deep Learning Image Classification Flutter Application

## Overview

This Flutter application utilizes a deep learning model for image classification. The model is trained to recognize various objects/categories in images. This markdown file serves as a guide to set up and use the application.

## Project Structure

- **assets**: Contains the trained deep learning model file and any necessary resources.
- **lib**: Contains the Dart code for the Flutter application.
  - **screens**: Screen files for different sections of the app.
  - **widgets**: Reusable widgets used across multiple screens.
  - **models**: Data models used by the application.
  - **services**: Services responsible for loading the deep learning model and performing inference.
  - **utils**: Utility functions and helper classes.
- **android**: Android-specific configuration files.
- **ios**: iOS-specific configuration files.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/purusho-390/DFU_APP.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd <project_directory>
3. Ensure Flutter is installed. If not, follow the Flutter installation instructions.
4. Install dependencies:
   flutter pub get
5. Place the trained deep learning model file (e.g., model.h5) in the assets directory.
6. Update the pubspec.yaml file to include the model file:
assets:
  - assets/model.h5

Usage
Run the application on an emulator or physical device:
   --flutter run
1.Once the application is running, you'll be presented with the main screen.
2. Select an image from your device's gallery or capture a new image using the camera.
3.The application will perform image classification using the deep learning model.
4.The result of the classification will be displayed on the screen, indicating the category/object detected in the image.
5.Optionally, additional functionalities such as saving or sharing the results may be included based on the application's requirements.
